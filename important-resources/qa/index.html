                    <p>Yes. The two plans cover all the same benefits, at the same coinsurance levels. The only difference is the deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. Your decision between these two plan options is based on whether you wish to have a lower premium in exchange for a higher deductible/out-of-pocket maximum (Silver option), or pay a higher premium and have a lower deductible/out-of-pocket maximum (Gold option). This is a very similar decision many individuals make when purchasing auto insurance: the higher the deductibles, the lower the premium, and vice versa.   </p>

                    <p> Yes.  HBC’s Associate per-pay deductions for HSA contributions are structured so your annual contribution will not exceed the IRS contribution limits. You may, however, elect to override these per-pay limits and make payroll-deducted HSA contributions that are in excess of the per-pay limits. <b> If you choose to make such higher contributions, you will be responsible to make certain your contributions do not exceed the IRS-imposed limits.</b> If you wish to override HBC’s per-pay period contribution limits, you may do so by calling HBC’s Benefits Service Center at 1-800-498-8705. All HSA contributions that exceed the per-pay limits must be confirmed by fax or email to HBC’s Benefits Service Center by the form provided. You may also make additional contributions directly to your account custodian, HSA Bank. Direct contributions will be tax-deductible (up to IRS limits) on your federal tax return. Please note that HBC and its benefit partners will <u><b>not</b></u> responsible if you make excess HSA contributions during the year, so please plan your HSA contributions accordingly.

                    <p> Yes, however, if the funds are withdrawn for any expense other than a qualified medical expense, the IRS will impose a 20% penalty tax. After you reach age 65 you can withdraw the funds without penalty but the amounts withdrawn for non-medical expenses will be taxable as ordinary income. Please note, the HSA is a bank account, so you can only access up to the current balance of your HSA. If you do not have enough in your HSA to pay a bill, you have the option to pay out-of-pocket and then reimburse yourself for the expense from your HSA once the funds are available.

                    <p>The purpose of an HSA is to save money to pay for current and future medical costs. HSA’s are set up to be tax-advantaged accounts in order to help encourage people to contribute and save for medical costs.  If funds are withdrawn for purposes other than medical before age 65, a 20% penalty is imposed.  This penalty is imposed by the IRS to help deter use of this money for anything other than medical, similar to how a 401k/IRA is set up for retirement.

                    <p>The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, includes both the individual mandate and the employer mandate. The individual mandate requires that most Americans have qualifying health care coverage or potentially face a fine. The employer mandate requires employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees to offer health care coverage to their full-time employees or potentially face a fine. Much like the Form W-2 is used to determine whether or not you owe taxes, the IRS will use the information reported from your Form 1095-C to determine whether you (or your employer) may have to pay a fine for failing to comply with the Affordable Care Act. <br><br>
The Form 1095-C contains important information about the health care coverage offered or provided to you by your employer. Information from the form may be referenced when filing your tax return and/or to help determine your eligibility for a premium tax credit. Think of the form as your “proof of insurance” for the IRS. <br><br>
If you or a family member enrolled in health care coverage at any time in 2016, you will receive a Form 1095 in 2018 from the entity that provided the coverage. For example, if you were determined to be a full-time employee or were enrolled in coverage through your employer, you will receive a 1095-C from your employer.
