            <br><b>Overview.</b> 
Reduce your commuting expenses by taking advantage of Commuter Benefits. The IRS allows for certain work-related transit and parking expenses to be deducted from your paycheck on a pre-tax basis. Because you do not pay taxes on these expenses, you can SAVE BIG! <br><br>

For 2018, the IRS allows up to $260 a month* pre-tax for transportation costs and up to $260 a month* for parking costs to be deducted pre-tax. Anything you purchase over those amounts is a post-tax deduction. <br><br>

            <b>Substantial Tax Advantages</b> 
Reduce your taxes by the amount of transit and parking you purchase, subject to IRS limits. By participating in the benefit, you are giving yourself a raise! <br><br>

            <b>Simple Ordering Process.</b> 
Ordering transit and parking is as easy as 1…2…3. Simply log in to your online account, order your parking or transit passes or vouchers and they will be mailed directly to you, or if you elect, your parking provider will be paid directly. The total pre-tax amount of your purchase will be deducted from your paycheck. You can pay for post-tax orders with a credit card. <br><br>

           <b> Multiple Uses.</b> 
Use for a number of your work-related transportation and parking expenses, including trains, buses, subways, ferries, vanpools and parking. <br><br>

          <b>  Wallet Wise and Environmentally Friendly.</b> 
Save money on gas while improving air quality and reducing energy consumption, automobile congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. </p>

          Since you use pre-tax payroll dollars to pay for your parking and transit expenses, you may save up to $1,872 or more each year (assuming a combined tax rate of 30%).  <br><br>

Here is an example of someone who drives to a suburban transit station and boards a transit train to work. The person in this example deducts the maximum for both types of expenses and has a combined tax rate of 30%. This person would save more than $1,000 per year in tax savings. <br><br>   </p>

<p>
 The amount that you spend on transit or parking can be paid for with pre-tax money. When you order transit and parking online, the value of your order is automatically deducted from your paycheck. Your yearly taxable income is reduced by the amount of your purchase. For tax years beginning after January 1, 2018, the IRS allows up to $260 a month pre-tax for transportation costs and up to $260 a month pre-tax for parking costs. Any amount beyond that becomes a post-tax deduction. Benefit limits are subject to IRS regulations.<br><br>

Assuming a combined tax rate of 30%, if you spend $260 on transportation and $260 on parking each month, you can save $1,872 per year. That's like getting more than 4 and a half months for free!

                           HBC’s Commuter benefits are provided for travel between your home and place of employment. If your employment with HBC ends and you have unused funds in your account, you may be required to submit new ordering instructions to cancel your election. You will have ninety (90) days from the date your employment ends to use the funds on your Commuter Check Card for eligible expenses. Any unused pre-tax funds will be forfeited to your employer, and any post-tax funds will be refunded to you at the end of the ninety (90)-day period.<br><br>
                           When your employment ends, notification of your termination will be passed to ConnectYourCare and your account (and any orders) will be cancelled.  This process can take 1-2 weeks.  If you have an order which processes for the benefit month following your termination, you will be responsible for the payment of the order through a deduction on your last paycheck. </p>
