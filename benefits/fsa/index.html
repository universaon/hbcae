        Flexible Spending Accounts
        </h2><br>
        
        <p>
          Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) allow you to set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified out-of-pocket health care or dependent care expenses. Because the money is deducted from your paycheck on a pre-tax basis, you will reduce the amount of your taxable income.<br><br>

HBC offers a Limited Purpose Health Care FSA, a General Purpose Health Care FSA and a Dependent Care FSA. These accounts are separate – you cannot use money from a Health Care FSA to cover expenses eligible under the Dependent Care FSA or vice versa.
        </p><hr>

        <h4>
          HOW FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS WORK

        </h4>
        <ol class="listn">
          <li>Each year, you decide how much to set aside for health care and/or dependent care expenses.</li>
          <li>Your contributions are deducted from your paycheck on a pre-tax basis in equal installments throughout the calendar year.</li>
            <li>As you incur health care or dependent care expenses throughout the year, you’ll need to submit a claim form for reimbursement. Your claim will be processed, and you will be reimbursed from your account.
              The Health Care FSA also includes a payment card that you can use to pay for eligible expenses at the point of sale. If you use the card to pay for your eligible medical expense, you will not have to file a claim for reimbursement, as you have not had any out of pocket cost. However, you should retain your receipts as you may be required to provide them to substantiate your expenses.</li>
          
<li>Be sure to calculate your expenses conservatively when making your FSA elections. IRS regulations require that you forfeit any money left in your account after the claims submission deadline. Only claims incurred during the calendar year while covered by the FSA are eligible for reimbursement.</li>
          <li>Your full plan year Health Care FSA election is available for reimbursement immediately; only contributions made through payroll deduction are available for use under the dependent care FSA account.</li>
          <li><b>You MUST actively enroll or re-enroll in the FSAs each year. You are NOT automatically re-enrolled.</b></li>
        </ol>
