         HBC Wellness Incentive
        </h2><br>

        
      <p>

Living a healthy lifestyle is key to improving and maintaining good health. HBC is taking steps to encourage you to make healthy living a priority. The primary initiative to promote good health is the Wellness Incentive. You can earn incentive dollars in your HSA for 2018 when you complete the Wellness Incentive requirements described below.

  </p><hr>
        <h4>
          What is the Wellness Incentive?
        </h4>


        <p>One of HBC's goals is to positively impact our Associate’s health and minimize both your and HBC’s overall health care costs through wellness. To further this goal, HBC’s Wellness Incentive program focuses on getting you:</p>

                    <ul class="listn">

                      <li>Engaged with your personal physician through an Annual Wellness Visit, and</li><br>
                      <li>Aware of ways to enhance your personal health and well-being through the completion of your confidential Health Risk Assessment (HRA).</li><br>
                      
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Wellness Incentive Contributions</h5> 

                    <ul class="listc">
                      <li>If you are enrolled in Associate Only coverage under the Gold, Silver or Bronze medical plan options and you complete the wellness requirements, you are eligible to receive up to a <b>$250* employer contribution into your HSA.</b></li><br>
                      <li>If you are enrolled in Associate + Spouse/Domestic Partner or Associate + Family coverage under the Gold, Silver or Bronze medical plan options, and both you <b>AND</b> your covered spouse/domestic partner complete the wellness requirements, you will be eligible to receive up to a <b>$500* employer contribution into your HSA.</b> If only you complete the wellness requirements, you are eligible to receive up to a <b>$250* employer contribution into your HSA</b>. Additionally, if only your spouse/domestic partner completes the requirments and you do not, he/she can independently earn the Wellness Incentive.</li><br>
                      <li>If you are enrolled in Associate + Child(ren) coverage under the Gold, Silver or Bronze medical plan options, only you have to complete the wellness requirements to earn up to the full <b>$500* employer contribution into your HSA.</b></li>


                    </ul><br>
                    
                    <p>
                      <i>*The Wellness Incentive contributions are in addition to the automatic employer contributions you receive for enrolling in the Gold or Silver HBC medical plan and opening an HSA and may be pro-rated based on a date of eligibility or wellness requirement completion.  </i>

                    <p>
                      To be eligible for the Wellness Incentive, you must complete the following requirements: 
                    </p>
                    <ul style="margin-left:1.1176cm;line-height:2.6" class="listc">
                      <li><b>An annual Physical Exam* (obtained after July 1, 2017) </b></li>

                    <p>
                      <b>IMPORTANT:</b>Both requirements must be completed for you to receive your 2018 Wellness Incentive, and your Incentive amount will be based on the date you complete your second requirement.  To receive the full Incentive you must complete both requirements by March 31, 2018.

        Biometric testing raises individual awareness around critical health values, but testing alone does not promote early detection, early action and long-term health improvement. Physician Engagement, starting with your Annual Well-person Physical Exam, is much more effective in improving Associate health and in diagnosing and treating emerging health issues before they become major health issues.<br><br>

        At your doctor visit a thorough health history will be obtained, biometrics will be tested, and age- and gender-appropriate tests and screenings will be recommended. And your medical information is completely private; HBC never sees personal health information on any Associate or dependent.<br><br>

        An annual physical exam obtained between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 will be counted. Please note, an annual well woman visit with an OB/GYN will count toward meeting the requirement. Cigna will automatically report your completion of the physical exam to HBC for purposes of the Wellness Incentive.
