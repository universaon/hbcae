         Health Savings Account Details
        </h2><br>
        <p>
          If you enroll in HBC’s Gold, Silver or Bronze Consumer Driven Health Plan (CDHP), a Health Savings Account (HSA) is automatically set up in your name, and an HSA Welcome Kit from HSA Bank is sent to your home address. It is important that you carefully review the Welcome Kit from HSA Bank and confirm you are eligible to open an HSA. You can also access the Welcome Kit information using the links below.<b> Please note:</b> If you are enrolled in Medicare or participate in another health plan (not a high deductible plan), you are <b>not eligible</b> to open an HSA.

  Your HSA debit card will be mailed to your home from HSA Bank and will automatically be activated when you use it to make a payment. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <i><b>Please Note: An HSA cannot be set up if your home address on record is a P.O. Box. If this applies, you must update your address, or you will not receive or be able to make contributions. Saks Associates: changes may be made through Oracle self-service; L&amp;T Associates: notify your HR representative to update your address.</b> </i>
        </p><br>
        
        <p>
          If you do not want the HSA to remain open, such as because of ineligibility, you MUST take action to close your account. Please contact HSA Bank at 855-731-5225 for more information or to close your HSA. If you do not take action to close your HSA, your account will remain open and active.

          HSA CONTRIBUTIONS

        <h5>
          HBC Contributions 
        </h5>
       <p>
         If you participate in the Gold or Silver CDHP, HBC will make an initial lump sum deposit to your HSA. HBC will also make another HSA contribution for Associates (or, for Associate + spouse/domestic partner or Associate + family coverage – for Associates and spouses/domestic partners) enrolled in the Gold, Silver or Bronze CDHP  who complete the Wellness Incentive requirements. The Wellness Incentive consists of an online Health Assessment through Cigna and an annual exam. If you cover a spouse/domestic partner on an HBC medical plan, you can both complete the requirments on an individual basis to be eligible for the Wellness Incentive, independent of one another. HBC will make the appropriate contributions into your HSA as soon as administratively possible.  <br><br>

         <b>Note:</b> You may receive a prorated automatic employer contribution based on the month you are eligible for benefits. Depending on the completion date of both the Health Assessment and annual exam, your Wellness Incentive contribution amount may be prorated as well.<a href="../../app_themes/blankcanvas/hbc2016test/docs/2018/HSA Proration Schedule_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" > Click here</a> to view the HSA Contribution Proration Schedule.

        </p><br>
        
        
<h5>
  Associate Contributions
        </h5>
        <p>
          Regardless of which plan you participate in, including the Bronze CDHP, Associates may make contributions to their HSA as long as the total of all HBC and Associate contributions combined does not exceed annual IRS limits*. (For 2018: $3,450 for single coverage; $6,900 for family coverage; plus an additional $1,000 “catch up” contribution for individuals age 55 and older.)<br><br>

 HBC’s Associate per-pay deductions for HSA contributions have been structured so your annual contribution will not exceed the IRS contribution limits. Associates may, however, elect to override these per-pay limits and make payroll-deducted HSA contributions that are in excess of the per-pay limits.  <b>If you choose to make higher contributions, it is your responsibility to ensure that your total contributions do not exceed the IRS-imposed limits.</b> <br><br>

 You may also make additional contributions directly to your account custodian, HSA Bank. Direct contributions will be tax-deductible (up to IRS limits) on your federal tax return. <br><br>

 Please note that HBC and HBC’s benefit partners will not be responsible if you make excess HSA contributions during the year, so please plan your HSA contributions accordingly. <br><br>

 If you wish to override HBC’s per-pay period contribution limits, you may do so by calling HBC’s Benefits Service Center at 1-800-498-8705. All HSA contributions that exceed the per-pay limits must be confirmed by fax or e-mail to HBC’s Benefits Service Center on the form provided. <br><br>

 HSA contributions will be made as long as you are actively employed at the time the payment is made. 
        </p><br><br>
        
        <p>
          <i>*Note: The annual IRS limit is prorated for any partial-year of eligibility, except during your first year of eligibility. You may make contributions up to the IRS limit as long as you remain enrolled in a qualifying CDHP and remain eligible to make HSA contributions through December of the following year. </i><br><br>
