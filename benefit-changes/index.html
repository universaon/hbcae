2018 Benefit Changes

        </h2>


                  
         HBC strives to provide Associates with comprehensive, high quality health care for you and your family at an affordable cost. While health care costs have increased, and are expected to do so again in 2018, HBC is doing everything possible to minimize the impact to Associate premiums; but, managing health care costs requires a partnership with you and HBC.
         <br><br>
        For 2018, HBC is putting a new focus on your wellness. By helping you maintain and improve your overall health and well-being, we can work together to minimize both your and HBC’s overall health care costs in the coming years. 
        <br><br>
        The highlights below provide an overview of the benefit changes for 2018. 

          </p>

          <hr>

        <h4>Action Required If You Are Enrolled in an HBC Medical Plan!</h4>

          <p>If you are currently enrolled in an HBC medical plan, you MUST actively:</p>

          <ul class="listc">
              <li>Certify/re-certify your eligibility for a tobacco-free discount and/or</li>
              <li>Confirm eligibility for the  spousal surcharge waiver (if applicable). </li>

          </ul>

          <br>

          <p>If you do not take action, you will automatically be charged the tobacco-user premium AND spousal surcharge (if covering a spouse).<br><br>

          If you elect to enroll in an HBC medical plan for 2018 during this year’s Annual Enrollment, you will be asked to certify your tobacco-user status and confirm eligibility for the spousal surcharge waiver (if applicable) during your enrollment process. </p>

          <hr>

        <h4>2018 Premiums</h4>
          <p>In 2017, HBC reduced Associate medical contributions, and will again absorb the majority of health care costs in 2018.  </p>

          <ul class="listc">
              <li>Most Associates will not see an increase in their medical premiums.</li>
              <li>Supplemental benefits, life insurance and LTD premiums (with the exception of applicable age-based changes), will not change.  </li>
              <li>There is an increase in Dental premiums for 2018.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To view premiums and surcharge information, visit the <a href="../enrollment-rates/rates/index.html">2018 Premiums</a> page. Premiums are effective January 1, 2018.</p>

          <hr>

        <h4>HSA (Health Savings Account) Contributions for 2018</h4>

          <h5>HBC Contributions</h5>
              <ul class="listc">
                  <li>HBC will provide a lump sum contribution to your HSA if you are enrolled in either the Gold or Silver CDHP.  </li>
                  <li>Covered Associates will receive up to a $250 contribution for Associate Only coverage, and up to a $500 contribution for Associate + 1 or more dependents.</li>

              </ul>
              <br>

         <h5>Associate Contributions</h5>
         <p>Associate contributions remain voluntary. </p>
              <ul class="listc">
                  <li>Current elections will roll-over, and you have the ability to make changes anytime throughout the year. </li>
                  <li>The 2018 annual HSA contribution limit has been increased to $3,450 for Associate Only coverage and $6,900 for Family coverage. </li>
                  <li>Individuals age 55 and over can also contribute up to an additional $1,000 in “catch up” contributions.</li>

              </ul>
              <hr>
          <h4>Wellness Program Enhancements (Available to covered CDHP members)</h4>  

          <p>To further HBC’s goal to positively impact our Associate’s health and minimize overall health care costs for everyone, we have made enhancements to the Wellness Program. We believe these enhancements provide added incentive to help you maintain or improve your health and earn contributions to a Health Savings Account (HSA) to help pay for out-of-pocket expenses or save for the future.
          </p> 

          <h5>Extended Eligibility  </h5>
          <ul class="listc">
            <li>In 2016 and 2017, Bronze plan participants were not eligible for the Wellness Incentive HSA contribution. For 2018, an Associate enrolled in any of HBC’s three medical plan options (Gold, Silver or Bronze CDHP) will be eligible to receive the Wellness Incentive contribution for completing the Wellness requirements.</li>
            <li>Associates and spouses/domestic partners have the ability to earn the incentive individually. If your spouse/domestic partner is enrolled in your HBC medical plan, he/she can independently earn the Incentive by meeting both Wellness Incentive requirements listed below. Even if you do not complete the requirements, you will be eligible to receive the Spouse Incentive. If the spousal incentive is earned it will be deposited in your HSA account.</li>

          </ul> <br>
          
          <h5>New Wellness Incentive Requirements</h5>

          <p>While biometric testing raises individual awareness around critical health values, testing alone does not promote early detection. Physician engagement, including an Annual Well-person Physical Exam, is more effective in improving, diagnosing and treating health issues. That is why HBC decided to enhance our Wellness Incentive requirements.
          </p>

          <ul class="listc">
            <li>Beginning January 1, 2018, you and/or your spouse/domestic partner must complete the following requirements to receive HBC’s Wellness Incentive contribution to your Health Savings Account (HSA)

              <ul class="listc">
                <li>An Annual Well-Person Exam with your Physician (in-network covered at 100%)</li>
                <li>A Health Risk Assessment on the <a target="_blank" href="https://my.cigna.com/web/public/guest">myCigna.com</a> web portal</li>
              </ul>



            </li>
            <li>Both requirements must be completed by June 30, 2018 for you to receive your 2018 Wellness Incentive. 
              <ul class="listc">
                <li>An annual physical exam obtained between <b>July 1, 2017</b> and <b>June 30, 2018</b> will be counted.</li>
                <li>Your Health Risk Assessment must be completed between <b>January 1, 2018</b> and <b>June 30, 2018</b> to be counted.</li>
              </ul>


             </li>

          </ul>
          <br>

          <h5>New Program for Covered Expectant Mothers</h5>

          <p>Having a baby is an exciting time! HBC wants to encourage you to learn more about the things you can do to stay healthy for you and your baby.  </p>


          <ul class="listc">
            <li>Expectant mothers enrolled in an HBC CDHP can take advantage of the new Healthy Pregnancy/Healthy Babies incentive program.</li>
            <li>Eligible participants can earn gift cards for enrolling and successfully completing the program.</li>
          </ul><br>

           <hr>



          <h4>Enhanced Coverage for Autism Treatment in 2018</h4>

            <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges, and impacts an estimated 1 in 68 school-aged children. Effective January 1, 2018, HBC’s medical plans will cover all commonly-prescribed Autism treatments, subject to both pre-service and concurrent medical necessity reviews by Cigna, for children enrolled in HBC’s medical plans. These treatments include:</p>

                <ul class="listc">
                  
                    <li> Applied Behavior Analysis:  ABA is an intensive behavior intervention program used to treat Autism spectrum disorders. ABA implements and evaluates environmental modifications using behavioral stimuli and consequences to produce socially significant improvement in behavior.</li>
                    <li>Short-Term Rehabilitation:  Includes speech therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy, rendered by medical specialists for the treatment of Autism.</li>

                </ul>




          <hr>

          <h4>Prescription Benefit Changes for 2018</h4>
          <p>HBC will add the following to enhance your Prescription plan through CVS Health for 2018:</p>

          <ul class="listc">
            <li><u><b>Pharmacy Advisor Counseling at CVS:</b></u>  If you or your covered family have a chronic illness and are taking prescription medications, you can receive one-on-one counseling, face-to-face or by telephone, with a CVS pharmacist.  You will receive education on new prescriptions, any potential side effects and how to avoid or minimize them, the importance of taking all medication as prescribed by your physician, and additional counseling on your health and how to reach your health goals.</li><br>


            <li><u><b>Transform Diabetes Care (TDC):</b></u> If you are a diabetic, this program will give you personalized support at CVS MinuteClinic, CVS/Pharmacy, and through a connected meter to help you control your A1C and glucose levels through diet, activity, testing and consistently taking your medication – all designed to help you improve your health and well-being.</li><br>

            <li><u><b>ACA Statin Changes:</b></u> If you are taking a low to moderate dose <u>generic</u> statin medication, the cost of these drugs will not be subject to plan deductibles and copays effective January 1, 2018 (when taken in accordance with the Federal <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1">statin recommendation)</a>. For statin prescriptions taken outside the recommended age ranges and/or strengths, and for name brand statins, the standard plan deductibles and copayments will apply.</li><br>
            
           

            <li><u><b>Prescription Copay Cards will not count toward Deductible and Out-of-Pocket limits:</b></u> Starting January 1, 2018, only the amount you actually pay for your prescriptions will be applied toward your Deductible and Out-of-Pocket maximum. Some specialty drug manufacturers provide copayment assistance cards to help lower patient out-of-pocket costs; however, since such payments are not amounts you have had to pay out-of-pocket, any third-party copayment assistance used will not count toward your Deductible or maximum Out-of-Pocket limit. This change does not affect copay assistance programs provided by foundations or financial needs based copay assistance. CVS/Caremark will provide additional information to affected associates.

</li>


          </ul>
        

            <hr>

          <h4>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</h4>

          <p>Remember to enroll or re-enroll in a Health Care or Dependent Care FSA if you want one for 2018. Enrollment is not automatic and your 2017 elections do not carryover into 2018.<br><br>
            <i>Review the benefits website for more information on the benefits available to you, premiums, resources and enrollment instructions to help you with your decisions for Annual Enrollment and throughout the year. </i>
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h4>2018 Enrollment</h4>
          <p>This year you may complete your enrollment one of three ways: over the phone by calling the HBC Benefits Service Center at 1-800-498-8705, with the help of a Benefits Counselor at an Enrollment Cafe’ (select locations) or online at <a href="https://leplb0840.portal.hewitt.com/web/upcba/login?tgtSite=06125" target="blank" >hbc.benefitsnow.com.</a></p>


          <hr>
          
          <h4>
           Upgraded Online Enrollment System
          </h4>
          <p>
          HBC’s On-line enrollment system is new and upgraded, so even if you have used the online enrollment system in the past you must create a new login ID to enroll online.  The first time you access the system click on "Are you a new user?", then follow the prompts to register and create your own login credentials. You will need the following information to verify your identity and set up your account:</p>

              <ul class="listc">
                  <li>Last four digits of your social security number</li>
                  <li>Your date of birth</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>Once you have set up your account, sign in, select “Annual Enrollment”, and click “Enroll Now” to begin.<br><br>
                The new online enrollment system will also be available in Spanish!</p>

      <br>

       

          <u><i><h5>Important Information about Online Enrollment</h5></i></u>
          <p>When enrolling online you must complete the full enrollment process (including printing your confirmation statement) to ensure your elections are what you intended. Any changes you make in the Enrollment System  are saved in “real time” meaning- as you make them. <b>Therefore, if you leave the system after any enrollment section, any changes you have made up to that point will be saved. If you do not go back and complete the enrollment process through printing and reviewing your confirmation statement, your incomplete benefit elections will become your final benefit elections for 2018.</b> </p><br><br>
